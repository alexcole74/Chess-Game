# Takeaways

This project was extremely interesting for me as I was able to explore the pygames library and write a program that involves images that are updated constantly while also using my object-oriented skills with various data structures. Chess is a game that I enjoy a lot, and writing in all the different rules such as castling, stalemates, or promoting pieces was very difficult yet rewarding. This is also one of the bigger projects I have done so far so it was helpful to practice debugging skills and working my way through problems through testing. In the future adding features such as names/accounts or a bot that plays against you could be directions I could take this project, but for now I'll practice against my friends
